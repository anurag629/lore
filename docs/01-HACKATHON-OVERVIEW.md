## Project Vision

**Lore** aims to revolutionize how creators manage, monetize, and collaborate on intellectual property in the digital age.

### The Problem We're Solving

Traditional IP management is:
- **Centralized** - Controlled by intermediaries (publishers, labels, studios)
- **Opaque** - Hidden royalty calculations and payment delays
- **Complex** - Legal barriers and high entry costs
- **Fragmented** - No unified platform for derivatives and remixes
- **Time-consuming** - Manual content creation and documentation

### Our Solution

A decentralized platform that:
- **Democratizes IP Rights** - Anyone can register and protect their work
- **Automates Royalties** - Smart contracts handle payments automatically
- **Enables Collaboration** - Derivative works tracked transparently
- **Accelerates Creation** - AI assists with content generation
- **Reduces Costs** - Free AI models keep operating costs at $0
